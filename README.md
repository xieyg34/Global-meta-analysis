# Summary
The study utilized a dataset of 6508 samples from 113 vertebrate species, analyzed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and metagenomic sequencing analysis. The results highlight the significant role of host diet patterns and climate factors in shaping the gut microbiome across vertebrates, besides offering insights into antibiotic resistance gene mobility between vertebrate gut microbiomes and their sympatric soil biological environment.
